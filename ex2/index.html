            <b><i>The Giant panda.</i></b>
        </h2>

        <p>
            The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca, sometimes panda bear or simply panda), is a bear species endemic to China.
            It is characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to
            distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora,
            the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet.
            Giant pandas in the wild occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion.
            In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.<br>

        <ul><li>Classification</li></ul>

            <p>
                For many decades, the precise taxonomic classification of the giant panda was under debate because it shares
                characteristics with both bears and raccoons. However, molecular studies indicate the giant panda is a true bear,
                part of the family Ursidae. These studies show it diverged about 19 million years ago from the common ancestor
                 of the Ursidae; it is the most basal member of this family and equidistant from all other extant bear species.
                 The giant panda has been referred to as a living fossil.

        <ul><li>Subspecies</li></ul>

            <p>
                Two subspecies of giant panda have been recognized on the basis of distinct cranial measurements, colour patterns, and population genetics.<br><br>
                <strong>The nominate subspecies,</strong> A. m. melanoleuca, consists of most extant populations of the giant panda. These animals are
                principally found in Sichuan and display the typical stark black and white contrasting colours.<br><br>
                <strong>The Qinling panda,</strong> A. m. qinlingensis, is restricted to the
                Qinling Mountains in Shaanxi at elevations of 1,300-3,000 m (4,300-9,800 ft). The typical black and white pattern of Sichuan giant
                pandas is replaced with a light brown and white pattern. The skull of A. m. qinlingensis is smaller than its relatives,
                and it has larger molars. A detailed study of the giant panda's genetic history from 2012 confirms that the separation
                of the Qinlin population occurred about 300,000 years ago, and reveals that the non-Qinlin population further diverged into two groups,
                named the Minshan and the Qionglai-Daxiangling-Xiaoxiangling-Liangshan group respectively, about 2,800 years ago.<br>
